# Input Gateway

The Input Gateway handles control devices that are not capable of running a Web Browser. This allows Sofie to integrate directly with devices such as: Hardware Panels, GPI input, MIDI devices and external systems being able to send an HTTP Request.

To install it, begin by downloading the latest release of [Input Gateway from GitHub](https://github.com/nrkno/sofie-input-gateway/releases). You can now run the `input-gateway.exe` file inside the extracted folder. A warning window may popup about the app being unrecognized. You can get around this by selecting _More Info_ and clicking _Run Anyways_.

Much like [Package Manager](./installing-package-manager), the Sofie instance that Input Gateway needs to connect to is configured through command line arguments. A minimal configuration could look something like this.

```bash
input-gateway.exe --host <Core Host Name> --port <Core HTTP(S) port> --https --id <Peripheral Device Id> --token <Peripheral Device Token/Password>
```

If not connecting over HTTPS, remove the `--https` flag.

Input Gateway can be launched from [CasparCG Launcher](./installing-connections-and-additional-hardware/casparcg-server-installation#installing-the-casparcg-launcher). This will make management and log collection easier on a production system.

You can now open the _Sofie&nbsp;Core_, `http://localhost:3000`,  and navigate to the _Settings page_. You will see your _Input Gateway_ under the _Devices_ section of the menu. In _Input Devices_ you can add devices that this instance of Input Gateway should handle. Some of the device integrations will allow you to customize the Feedback behavior. The *Device ID* property will identify a given Input Device in the Studio, so this property can be used for fail-over purposes.

## Supported devices and protocols

Currently, input gateway supports:

* Stream Deck panels
* Skaarhoj panels - _TCP Raw Panel_ mode
* X-Keys panels
* MIDI controllers
* OSC
* HTTP

## Input Gateway-specific functions

### Shift Registers

Input Gateway supports the concept of _Shift Registers_. A Shift Register is an internal variable/state that can be modified using Actions, from within [Action Triggers](../configuration/settings-view.md#actions). This allows for things such as pagination, _Hold Shift + Another Button_ scenarios, and others on input devices that don't support these features natively. _Shift Registers_ are also global for all devices attached to a single Input Gateway. This allows combining multiple Input devices into a single Control Surface.

When one of the _Shift Registers_ is set to a value other than `0` (their default state), all triggers sent from that Input Gateway become prefixed with a serialized state of the state registers, making the combination of a _Shift Registers_ state and a trigger unique.

If you would like to have the same trigger cause the same action in various Shift Register states, add multiple Triggers to the same Action, with different Shift Register combinations.

Input Gateway supports an unlimited number of Shift Registers, Shift Register numbering starts at 0.

## Branches

This repository uses the following branches:

- **_master_** is our main branch. We consider it stable and it is used in production.
- The **_releaseXX_** branches are our in-development branches. When a release is ready, we decide to “freeze” that branch and create a new **_releaseXX+1_** branch.

We require contributions to be based based on the latest **_release\*_** branch.
The [_Sofie Releases_](https://nrkno.github.io/sofie-core/releases) page collects the status and timeline of the releases.

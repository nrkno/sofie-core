	 * The `$anchor` keyword is used to specify such a fragment.  It is an

	 * as it is not a URI-reference.  An `{"$anchor": "foo"}` becomes the
	 * fragment `#foo` when used in a URI.
	 *
	 * The base URI to which the resulting fragment is appended is determined
	 * by the `$id` keyword as explained in the previous section.
	 * Two `$anchor` keywords in the same schema document MAY have the same

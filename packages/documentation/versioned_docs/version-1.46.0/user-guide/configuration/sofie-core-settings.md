# Sofie Core: System Configuration

_Sofie&nbsp;Core_ is configured at it's most basic level using a settings file and environment variables.

### Environment Variables

### Settings File

The settings file is an optional JSON file that contains some configuration settings for how the _Sofie&nbsp;Core_ works and behaves.

To use a settings file:

- During development: `meteor --settings settings.json`
- During prod: environment variable \(see above\)

The structure of the file allows for public and private fields. At the moment, Sofie only uses public fields. Below is an example settings file:

```text
{
    "public": {
        "frameRate": 25
    }
}
```

There are various settings you can set for an installation. See the list below:

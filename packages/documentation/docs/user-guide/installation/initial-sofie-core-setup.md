# Initial Sofie Core Setup

#### Prerequisites

- [Installed and running _Sofie&nbsp;Core_](installing-sofie-server-core)

Once _Sofie&nbsp;Core_ has been installed and is running you can begin setting it up. The first step is to navigate to the _Settings page_. Please review the [Sofie Access Level](../features/access-levels) page for assistance getting there.

To upgrade to a newer version or installation of new blueprints, Sofie needs to run its "Upgrade database" procedure to migrate data and pre-fill various settings. You can do this by clicking the _Upgrade Database_ button in the menu.

Fill in the form as prompted and continue by clicking _Run Migrations Procedure_. Sometimes you will need to go through multiple steps before the upgrade is finished.

You should also head to the Studio that has just been created, and setup some intiial configuration.

Next, you will need to add some [Blueprints](installing-blueprints) and add [Gateways](installing-a-gateway/intro) to allow _Sofie_ to interpret rundown data and then play out things.

# Supported Playout Devices

All playout devices are essentially driven through the _timeline_, which passes through _Sofie&nbsp;Core_ into the Playout Gateway where it is processed by the timeline-state-resolver. This page details which devices and what parts of the devices can be controlled through the timeline-state-resolver library. In general a blueprints developer can use the [timeline-state-resolver-types package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/timeline-state-resolver-types) to see the interfaces for the timeline objects used to control the devices.

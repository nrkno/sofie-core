A device integration has a couple of responsibilites in the Sofie eco system. First and foremost it should establish a connection with a foreign device. It should also be able to convert Sofie\'s idea of what the device should be doing into commands to control the device. And lastly it should export interfaces to be used by the blueprints developer.","sidebar":"forDevelopers"},"for-developers/device-integrations/options-and-mappings":{"id":"for-developers/device-integrations/options-and-mappings","title":"Options and mappings","description":"For an end user to configure the system from the Sofie UI we have to expose options and mappings from the TSR.

In Sofie we try to be strict about any playout operations needing to be state based, i.e. doing a transition operation on a vision mixer should be a result of a state change, not an action. However, there are things that are easier done with actions. For example cleaning up a playlist on a graphics server or formatting a disk on a recorder. For these scenarios we have added TSR Actions.","sidebar":"forDevelopers"},"for-developers/device-integrations/tsr-api":{"id":"for-developers/device-integrations/tsr-api","title":"TSR Integration API","description":"As of version 1.50, there still exists a legacy API for device integrations.

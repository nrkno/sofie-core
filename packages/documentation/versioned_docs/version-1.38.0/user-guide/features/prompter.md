# Prompter

See [Sofie views](sofie-views#prompter-view) for how to access the prompter page.

![Prompter screen before the first Part is taken](/img/docs/main/features/prompter-view.png)

The prompter will display the script for the Rundown currently active in the Studio. On Air and Next parts and segments are highlighted - in red and green, respectively - to aid in navigation. In top-right corner of the screen, a Diff clock is shown, showing the difference between planned playback and what has been actually produced. This allows the host to know how far behind/ahead they are in regards to planned execution.

![Indicators for the On Air and Next part shown underneath the Diff clock](/img/docs/main/features/prompter-view-indicators.png)

If the user scrolls the prompter ahead or behind the On Air part, helpful indicators will be shown in the right-hand side of the screen. If the On Air or Next part's script is above the current viewport, arrows pointing up will be shown. If the On Air part's script is below the current viewport, a single arrow pointing down will be shown.

## Customize looks

The prompter UI can be configured using query parameters:

## Controlling the prompter

The prompter can be controlled by different types of controllers. The control mode is set by a query parameter, like so: `?mode=mouse`.

| Query parameter         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Default                 | Controlled by both mouse and keyboard                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `?mode=mouse`           | Controlled by mouse only. [See configuration details](prompter#control-using-mouse-scroll-wheel)                                                                                                                                            |

| `?mode=shuttlekeyboard` | Controlled by a Contour Design ShuttleXpress, X-keys Jog and Shuttle or any compatible, configured as keyboard-ish device. [See configuration details](prompter#control-using-contour-shuttlexpress-or-x-keys)                              |
| `?mode=pedal`           | Controlled by any MIDI device outputting note values between 0 - 127 of CC notes on channel 8. Analogue Expression pedals work well with TRS-USB midi-converters. [See configuration details](prompter#control-using-midi-input-mode-pedal) |
| `?mode=joycon`          | Controlled by Nintendo Switch Joycon, using the HTML5 GamePad API. [See configuration details](prompter#control-using-nintendo-joycon-gamepad)                                                                                              |

#### Control using mouse \(scroll wheel\)

The prompter can be controlled in multiple ways when using the scroll wheel:

| Query parameter             | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `?controlmode=normal`       | Scrolling of the mouse works as "normal scrolling"                                                                                                                                       |
| `?controlmode=speed`        | Scrolling of the mouse changes the speed of scolling. Left-click to toggle, right-click to rewind                                                                                        |
| `?controlmode=smoothscroll` | Scrolling the mouse wheel starts continous scrolling. Small speed adjustments can then be made by nudging the scroll wheel. Stop the scrolling by making a "larger scroll" on the wheel. |

has several operating modes, described further below. All modes are intended to be controlled by a computer mouse or similar, such as a presenter tool.

#### Control using keyboard

Keyboard control is intended to be used when having a "keyboard"-device, such as a presenter tool.

| Scroll up    | Scroll down   |
| :----------- | :------------ |
| `Arrow Up`   | `Arrow Down`  |
| `Arrow Left` | `Arrow Right` |
| `Page Up`    | `Page Down`   |
|              | `Space`       |

#### Control using Contour ShuttleXpress or X-keys \(_?mode=shuttlekeyboard_\)

This mode is intended to be used when having a Contour ShuttleXpress or X-keys device, configured to work as a keyboard device. These devices have jog/shuttle wheels, and their software/firmware allow them to map scroll movement to keystrokes from any key-combination. Since we only listen for key combinations, it effectively means that any device outputing keystrokes will work in this mode.

From Release 30, the speedMap has a prefix: **shuttle\_** \(i.e. shuttle_speedMap\)

| Key combination                                            | Function                               |
| :--------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl` `Alt` `F1` ... `Ctrl` `Alt` `F7`                    | Set speed to +1 ... +7 \(Scroll down\) |
| `Ctrl` `Shift` `Alt` `F1` ... `Ctrl` `Shift` `Alt` `F7`    | Set speed to -1 ... -7 \(Scroll up\)   |
| `Ctrl` `Alt` `+`                                           | Increase speed                         |
| `Ctrl` `Alt` `-`                                           | Decrease speed                         |
| `Ctrl` `Alt` `Shift` `F8`, `Ctrl` `Alt` `Shift` `PageDown` | Jump to next Segment and stop          |
| `Ctrl` `Alt` `Shift` `F9`, `Ctrl` `Alt` `Shift` `PageUp`   | Jump to previous Segment and stop      |
| `Ctrl` `Alt` `Shift` `F10`                                 | Jump to top of Script and stop         |
| `Ctrl` `Alt` `Shift` `F11`                                 | Jump to Live and stop                  |
| `Ctrl` `Alt` `Shift` `F12`                                 | Jump to next Segment and stop          |

####

#### Control using midi input \(_?mode=pedal_\)

This mode listens to MIDI CC-notes on channel 8, expecting a linear range like i.e. 0-127. Sutiable for use with expression pedals, but any MIDI controller can be used. The mode picks the first connected MIDI device, and supports hot-swapping \(you can remove and add the device without refreshing the browser\).

If you want to use traditional analogue pedals with 5 volt TRS connection, a converter such as the _Beat Bars EX2M_ will work well.

From Release 30, the parameters for the pedal have a prefix: **pedal\_** \(i.e. pedal_speedMap, pedal_reverseSpeedMap etc\)

| Query parameter   | Type             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Default                                 |

![Yamaha FC7 mapped for both a forward (80-127) and backwards (0-35) range.](/img/docs/main/features/yamaha-fc7.jpg)

The default values allow for both going forwards and backwards. This matches the _Yamaha FC7_ expression pedal. The default values create a forward-range from 80-127, a neutral zone from 35-80 and a reverse-range from 0-35.

Any movement within forward range will map to the _speedMap_ with interpolation between any numbers in the _speedMap_. You can turn on `?debug=1` to see how your input maps to an output. This helps during calibration. Similarly, any movement within the backwards rage maps to the _reverseSpeedMap._

**Note:** The default values are set up to work with the _Yamaha FC7_ expression pedal, and will probably not be good for pedals with one continuous linear range from fully released to fully depressed. A suggested configuration for such pedals \(i.e. the _Mission Engineering EP-1_\) will be like:

#### Control using Nintendo Joycon \(_?mode=joycon_\)

This mode uses the browsers Gamapad API and polls connected Joycons for their states on button-presses and joystick inputs.

The Joycons can operate in 3 modes, the L-stick, the R-stick or both L+R sticks together. Reconnections and jumping between modes works, with one known limitation: **Transition from L+R to a single stick blocks all input, and requires a reconnect of the sticks you want to use.** This seems to be a bug in either the Joycons themselves or in the Gamepad API in general.

From Release 30, the parameters for the JoyCon have a prefix: **joycon\_** \(i.e. joycon_speedMap, joycon_reverseSpeedMap etc\)

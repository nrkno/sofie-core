# Initial Sofie Core Setup

#### Prerequisites

- [Installed and running _Sofie&nbsp;Core_](installing-sofie-server-core)

Once _Sofie&nbsp;Core_ has been installed and is running you can begin setting it up. The first step is to navigate to the _Settings page_. Please review the [Sofie Access Level](../features/access-levels) page for assistance getting there.

To upgrade to a newer version or installation of new blueprints, Sofie needs to run its "Upgrade database" procedure to migrate data and pre-fill various settings. You can do this by clicking the _Upgrade Database_ button in the menu.

![Update Database Section of the Settings Page](/img/docs/getting-started/settings-page-full-update-db.jpg)

Fill in the form as prompted and continue by clicking _Run Migrations Procedure_. Sometimes you will need to go through multiple steps before the upgrade is finished.

Next, you will need to add some [Blueprints](installing-blueprints) and add [Gateways](installing-a-gateway/intro) to allow _Sofie_ to interpret rundown data and then play out things.

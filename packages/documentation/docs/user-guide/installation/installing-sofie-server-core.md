# Quick install

## Installing for testing \(or production\)

### **Prerequisites**

**\(Linux\)** Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) and [docker-compose](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-18-04).  
**\(Windows\)** Install [Docker for Windows](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows).

### Installation

This docker-compose file automates the basic setup of the [Sofie-Core application](../../for-developers/libraries#main-application), the backend database and different Gateway options.

```yaml
# This is NOT recommended to be used for a production deployment.
# It aims to quickly get an evaluation version of Sofie running and serve as a basis for how to set up a production deployment.
version: '3.3'

  # Choose one of the following images, depending on which type of ingest gateway is wanted.
  # If using the Rundown Editor, then none of the below images are needed.
  # The Rundown Editor can be found here: https://github.com/SuperFlyTV/sofie-automation-rundown-editor

  #   depends_on:
  #     - core

  # mos-gateway:

  #   restart: always
  #   ports:

  #     - "10541:10541" # MOS Upper port
  #     # - "10542:10542" # MOS query port - not used
  #   command: yarn start -host core -port 3000 -id mosGateway0
  #   networks:
  #     - sofie
  #   depends_on:

  # inews-gateway:

  #   restart: always
  #   command: yarn start -host core -port 3000 -id inewsGateway0

  #     - core

networks:
  sofie:
  lan_access:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  db-data:
  sofie-store:
```

Create a `Sofie` folder, copy the above content, and save it as `docker-compose.yaml` within the `Sofie` folder.

Navigate to the _ingest-gateway_ section of `docker-compose.yaml` and select which type of _ingest-gateway_ you'd like installed by uncommenting it. Save your changes. If you are using the [Rundown Editor](rundown-editor), then no ingest gateways need to be uncommented.

Then open a terminal, `cd your-sofie-folder` and `sudo docker-compose up` \(just `docker-compose up` on Windows\).

Once the installation is done, Sofie should be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Next, you will need to install a Rundown Gateway. Visit [Rundowns & Newsroom Systems](installing-a-gateway/rundown-or-newsroom-system-connection/intro) to see which _Rundown Gateway_ is best suited for _your_ production environment.

### Tips for running in production

There are some things not covered in this guide needed to run _Sofie_ in a production environment:

- Logging: Collect, store and track error messages. [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana) and [logstash](https://www.elastic.co/logstash) is one way to do it.
- NGINX: It is customary to put a load-balancer in front of _Sofie&nbsp;Core_.
- Memory and CPU usage monitoring.

## Installing for Development

Installation instructions for installing Sofie-Core or the various gateways are available in the README file in their respective github repos.

Common prerequisites are [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).  
Links to the repos are listed at [Applications & Libraries](../../for-developers/libraries).

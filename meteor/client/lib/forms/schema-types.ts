	 * Using JSON Pointer fragments requires knowledge of the structure of the

	 * that is not tied to any particular structural location.  This allows a
	 * subschema to be relocated without requiring JSON Pointer references to
	 * be updated.
	 *
	 * The `$anchor` keyword is used to specify such a fragment.  It is an
	 * identifier keyword that can only be used to create plain name fragments.
	 *
	 * If present, the value of this keyword MUST be a string, which MUST start
	 * with a letter `[A-Za-z]`, followed by any number of letters, digits
	 * `[0-9]`, hyphens `-`, underscores `_`, colons `:`,
	 * or periods `.`.
	 *
	 * Note that the anchor string does not include the `#` character,
	 * as it is not a URI-reference.  An `{"$anchor": "foo"}` becomes the
	 * fragment `#foo` when used in a URI.
	 *
	 * The base URI to which the resulting fragment is appended is determined
	 * by the `$id` keyword as explained in the previous section.
	 * Two `$anchor` keywords in the same schema document MAY have the same
	 * value if they apply to different base URIs, as the resulting full URIs
	 * will be distinct.  However, the effect of two `$anchor` keywords
	 * with the same value and the same base URI is undefined.  Implementations

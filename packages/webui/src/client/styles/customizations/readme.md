# Custom styling

The Shelf system allows dashboard panels to have custom CSS classes added to their DOM elements. This allows additional styling to be added to achieve custom look and feel.

## NRK styles

NRK doesn't have a build-and-deploy pipeline for applying _private_ styles on top of the Core repo, and will be commiting their custom styles to this folder.

The folder structure is intended to avoid merge conflicts to other users of this Core repo.
